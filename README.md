# JBChestLog
An easy-to-use Bukkit plugin for Minecraft servers. Tap a chest with a stick to view its item history.

# Permissions
| Permission | Meaning |
|---|---|
| JBChestLog.view.own | View the history of any container you placed |
| JBChestLog.view.any | View the history of any container |
| JBChestLog.clear.own | Clear the history of any container you placed using /jbcl clear |
| JBChestLog.clear.any | Clear the history of any container using /jbcl clear | 
| JBChestLog.clear.all | Clear the history of all containers on the server using /jbcl clear all | 

# Nota bene
- This plugin can only show item history that happened while the plugin was running
- This plugin has no rollback function
- This plugin cannot lock chests

I use it for my whitelisted survival server with people who I trust will not grief in a major way, but I'd like to be able to detect small theft and expose thieves.
